# plunger-demo

This project demonstrates how to do a join in cascading 3.0.
[Plunger](https://github.com/HotelsDotCom/plunger)'s in-memory taps and junit matchers are used, to make unit testing a breeze.

Please note that this project currently depends on a snapshot version of plunger, which has to be built manually; see comments in pom.xml.
